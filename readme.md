# A performant Black Hole renderer in C# and HLSL
This renderer does it's best to ray-trace in real time an interactive black hole with an accretion disk, you can move rotate and zoom in anywhere you want

## Main Features:
- Light bending
- Accretion disk with volume (NOT volumetric, just 3D)
- Accretion disk's light emmision based on temperature and measured in nm wavelength
- wavelength redshift based on the disk's light direction
- the modified wavelength back to rgb
- Skybox distorsion, the stars in the background will also distort

## Performance 
I tested on 2 devices with the GPUs: rtx4060 (desktop) and Intel Raptor Lake-P (laptop), giving the following results:
- Desktop: 1920x1080p at ~300fps average (depends on the distance) 
- Laptop: 1280x720p at 60-30fps average (depends on the distance)

## Settings
Almost all the fun parameters are exposed in a .json file for you to edit at your pleasure

Some of the best parameters to change and play with are:
- FOV
- Step size (increase this one for a performace boost)
- Disk radius
- Disk temperature (this one will change the percieved color in the final image)
- Disk velocity
